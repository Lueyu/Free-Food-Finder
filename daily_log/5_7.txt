install python	
	python cannot be installed on cmd due to admin restriction
	RESOLUTION:
		attach anaconda python interpreter to vs code
		need to install Code Run extension on vs code
		reference: https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_42359863/article/details/106648673
		run without debugging; python debug console

	Remaining Problem:
	1. Still cannot run backend code(no module named flask)
		reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53355059/getting-error-no-module-named-flask-in-vscode-even-when-i-have-installed-flas
		trying to install requirement first and then rerun backend code
			pip install -r requirements.txt
			anaconda does not support linux-like commands
		trying pip install flask in anaconda console
			message: requirements already fulfilled
		
		general idea now:
			direct to local directory in backend folder
			install virtual env within the folder
			install all requirements using pip install -r requirements.txt
